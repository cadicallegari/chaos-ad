## Requirements

You will need [docker](https://www.docker.com) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run the project


## The Makifile will provide you some help to test, build and release your project

## Run locally

```
make run
```

## Testing

```
make check-integration
```

## Releasing


```
make release version=<version>
```

The final artifact generated by the makefile is a docker image, ready to be published in your registry
